# Project 4

In this project we have performed numerical studies of a two-dimensional Ising model using the Metropolis algorithm. 
Our report can be found in the folder "report". 

The programs used for generating the results are placed in the main folder. These include
* IsingBurnIn.cpp
--> "IsingBurnIn.cpp" is used for calculating the expected energy and magnetisation of the Ising model given a specific temperature and initial orientation. It writes out these properties, in addition to the total energy energy of the system for each Monte Carlo cycle is performs. It takes as arguments the output file name, the lattice dimension, the number of Monte Carlo cycles, the temperature and the orientation (given by either 'random' or 'ordered').
