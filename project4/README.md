# Project 4

In this project we have performed numerical studies of a two-dimensional Ising model using the Metropolis algorithm. 
Our report can be found in the folder 'report'. 

The programs used for generating the results are placed in the main folder. These include
* IsingBurnIn.cpp
* ParaIsing.cpp
